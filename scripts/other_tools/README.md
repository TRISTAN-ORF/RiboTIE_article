# Other tools

Existing tools for ORF delineation using ribosome profiling data have been compared to RIBO-former. This folder contains high-level scripts used to run the tool and obtain the results discussed in the paper.

Note that scripts have been run from `scripts/benchmark/` using the folder structure utilized [here](https://github.com/jdcla/RIBO_former).
